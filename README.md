# Python-Development-Assessment_Bilateral-Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the following tasks:
1. Reverse String with Vowel Capitalization: A Python function that reverses a string and capitalizes vowels while converting consonants to lowercase.
2. Count Unique Elements: A Python function that counts the number of unique elements in a list without using built-in functions related to counting or sets.
3. SQL Query: A SQL query that calculates total revenue by month for the last quarter.

# Prerequisites

To run the Python scripts, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
Python 3.6 or higher

# Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Biswatosh01/Python-Development-Assessment_Bilateral-Solutions.git
cd Python-Development-Assessment_Bilateral-Solutions


2. Run the Python Functions
You can run the provided Python functions using any Python IDE or directly from the command line.

Running the Reverse String Function:
python3 convert_string.py

This script takes a string as input and outputs the reversed string with vowels capitalized and consonants in lowercase.

Running the Count Unique Elements Function:
python3 count_unique.py

This script takes a list of elements as input and outputs the count of unique elements in the list.


3. Running the SQL Query:
The SQL query provided can be run in any SQL environment that supports PostgreSQL syntax.

Steps:
i) Copy the SQL query from revenue_by_month.sql.
ii) Paste it into your SQL environment or editor.
iii) Execute the query to calculate the total revenue generated in the last quarter, grouped by month.


# File Descriptions

1. convert_string.py: Contains the Python function for reversing a string with the specific transformation.
2. count_unique.py: Contains the Python function for counting unique elements in a list.
3. revenue_by_month.sql: Contains the SQL query to calculate total revenue by month for the last quarter.


# Examples

1. Reverse String with Vowel Capitalization
Input: "Hello, World!"
Output: "!dlrOw ,OllEh"

2. Count Unique Elements
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
Output: 5
